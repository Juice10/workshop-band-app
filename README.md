# What are we building?

From your host, [Joe Sepi](https://github.com/joesepi):

"I have been in bands since I was young and am always wishing I had some app to help me and my band in some way. I'm going to use all of those itches to drive a workshop building out a full-featured app to help today's DIY bands."

## Get started
