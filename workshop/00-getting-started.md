## What is LoopBack?

LoopBack is Node.js tool to rapidly build RESTful APIs. It is a mature project, currently at version 3.x. It is built on top of Express, so it has a very stable and widely-used foundation. It uses a command line interface to scaffold your application and build the config files to drive your LoopBack application. It is so quick and easy, it is almost magical. Let me show you:

## Prerequisites

As mentioned previously, you will need Node.js installed on your local machine. Included with Node.js is NPM, the Node Package Manager. You will use NPM to install LoopBack, by typing in your terminal:

`npm install -g loopback-cli`

This will install LoopBack globally (`-g`) to your machine so you can start a LoopBack application in any directory you choose.

Next Step: [Let's initialize our application](01-init.md).
